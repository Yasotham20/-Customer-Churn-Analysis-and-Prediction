Task 1: Data Preparation

Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploration.
Handled missing values in TotalCharges and encoded Churn for consistency.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated and visualized the overall churn rate.
Explored customer distribution by gender, partner status, and dependent status.
Analyzed tenure distribution and its relation with churn.
Investigated how churn varies across different contract types and payment methods.
Task 3: Customer Segmentation

Segmented customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.
Analyzed churn rates within these segments.
Identified high-value customers who are at risk of churning.
Task 4: Churn Prediction Model

Chose suitable machine learning algorithms for churn prediction.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Trained and evaluated multiple models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Performed feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Task 5: Model Evaluation and Interpretation

Evaluated the best predictive model using the testing dataset.
Interpreted model coefficients or feature importances to comprehend factors influencing churn.
Created ROC curves and calculated AUC for model performance assessment.
Task 6: Business Recommendations

Provided actionable recommendations to the business based on analysis and predictive models.
Suggested specific marketing strategies, retention offers, or customer engagement tactics.
Estimated the potential impact of these recommendations on revenue and churn rate.
Visualized the distribution of high-value customers across segments.
Conclusion

This project aimed to predict customer churn and provide insights for business improvement. Through data preparation, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, churn prediction modeling, model evaluation, and business recommendations, the project achieved its objectives. The findings and recommendations can be used to inform business decisions and improve customer retention.
